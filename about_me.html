            <h3>In the Office</h3>
            <p>
                I've worked in the aviation, space, automotive, and healthcare industries. My job has always been related
                to system design or software development. I tend to thrive with hard, open-ended problems that require
                novel solutions and cross-disciplinary collaboration. The diversity of these experiences has helped me
                communicate more efficiently with technical and non-technical groups.
            </p>
            <h3>In the Classroom</h3>
            <p>
                My undergraduate degree was in Aerospace Engineering. In addition to the coursework, I led a number of teams
                representing the school in competitions to design, build, and fly model aircraft.
            </p>
            <p>
                My graduate degree was in Computer Science. Most of the coursework touched on various aspects of Artificial 
                Intelligence. In particular I enjoyed building models to solve puzzles and games, predicting stock market
                behavior, and determining the location and optimal paths for autonomous vehicles.
            </p>
            <h3>Spare Time</h3>
            <p>
                At home, I enjoy spending time with my family as well as woodworking and home improvement projects.
                Outside of the house, I like hiking and biking. If I pass by any body of water, you can bet I'll stop to throw
                a few rocks in it. I play golf, basketball, and volleyball from time to time. Finally, 
                I always have an audiobook in progress and another on deck.
