            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>
                Winston is my virtual assistant. This project started as a fun way to ensure I 
                never forgot an important date but has continued to evolve over the years into 
                a clean way of providing daily updates as I wake up each morning. I spend the 
                most time working on this repo because I'll wake up thinking something like 
                "I should add weather information" and then decie to clean up or rework other 
                parts of the code while I'm working on the original update. On the surface this 
                is a fairly unimpressive program but it has proven to be helpful and fun to 
                maintain.

            <h3>Running the Program</h3>
            <p>
                This program is run using the following command structure:
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="code" class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-shell">python virt_asst.py</code></pre>

        <div class="container">
            <p>
                That said, I typically don't run this program manually. Instead, I have it set up to run 
                each morning as a cronjob from my home desktop. This works pretty well but I think it is 
                worth updating the desktop's settings to boot up automatically when power is available 
                to prevent any power outages from blocking the email from sending while I am away for a 
                few days.

            <h3>The Code</h3>
            <p>
                As the run command implies, the code runs from `personalAssistant.py`. After importing the 
                necessary libraries we see this line:
            </p>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="code" class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <pre class="line-numbers"><code class="language-shell">config_path = g.configPath(True)</code></pre>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="code" class="section">
        <div class="container">
            <p>
                This function is in `func_general.py` and is determining from which computer the code is running. 
                This is important for a few reasons. First, it allows for a local configuration path so you can store 
                data you don't want to accidently end up on the public internet outside a github repo. Most of the 
                time this would be handled using a `.gitignore` file but I like the idea of having additional 
                separation from my data and a constantly evolving code base. Is this overkill for mostly birthday 
                data? Absolutely, but these fun side projects are more about proven what I can do and not designing 
                the most efficient codebase.
            </p>
            <p>
                The second huge benefit that comes with a dynamic configuration path is that I can run this code
                quickly from each of my computers, with various operating systems, without needing a bunch of 
                input variables in my run command. The down side is that local data files can get out of sync if 
                you don't have an automated way to sync them. This can be solved by referencing a single source of 
                truth like a Google Drive file.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once you have your configuration file, these are a handful of variables that direct how the program 
                with execute. Here are a few examples:
            </p>
            <p><b>platform</b>: This is mainly a reference to which computer configuration the program is using for 
                debugging purposes.
            </p>
            <p><b>emailInTerminal</b>: This is a boolean field that determines when to print the email in your 
                terminal or actually send an email. While you're making code updates, it can be faster to 
                skip the time associated with sending and receiving an email.
            </p>
            <p><b>emailPreview</b>: When I added html formatting I added this output file as well that shows 
                what was sent. This can be useful for development and debugging.
            </p>
            <p><b>countriesFile</b>: This is a list of every country and its capital and there is a similar
                file for states. I like keeping this information fresh in my mind. Ultimately this information 
                appears at the end of the email as fake travel plans the assistant is currently completing.
            </p>
            <p><b>datesFile</b>: This is data for birthdays and anniversaries.</p>
            <p><b>greeting</b>: This is how the assistant greets you at the beginning or the email.</p>
            <p><b>assistantName</b>: Yes, you can give your assistant any name you want!</p>
            <p><b>from_email</b>: This is the sender email. Assuming you use your gmail account, you will 
                need to setup an `App Password` that corresponds to this email address.
            </p>
            <p><b>to_email</b>: This is the email recipient.</p>
            <p><b>subject</b>: Using `default` will give you an email title of "Daily Correspondence" plus 
                a date stamp. Alternatively, you can set a custom subject line here.
            </p>
            <p><b>eventOutlook</b>: This is how many days out the program will look to remind you of upcoming
                dates.</p>
            <p><b>lastDeparture</b>: The fake travel plans at the end of the email ensures that the previous 
                destination is the next days starting location, assuming the emails are sent consecutively 
                from the same computer. This helps reinforce the location and capital information as well as 
                play into the travel idea. This field will alternate between "country" and "state" and works with 
                the `lastStateId` or `lastCountryId` field to make the previously described functionality possible.
                This is automatically updated each time the program runs.
            </p>
            <p><b>lastStateId</b>: This is a rolling count to ensure that the state in the fake travel plans 
                is always changing. This is automatically updated each time the program runs.
            </p>
